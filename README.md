# CryptoClustering
Cryptocurrency Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
This project involves clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The data is first loaded into a DataFrame, and then visualized to understand its structure. Summary statistics are also generated to get a sense of the data distribution.

Data Preprocessing
The data is normalized using the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn. This ensures that all features have the same scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.

Clustering with K-Means
The K-Means algorithm is used to cluster the cryptocurrencies. The optimal number of clusters (k) is determined using the elbow method, which involves plotting the inertia (sum of squared distances to the nearest cluster center) for different values of k and looking for the “elbow” point where the inertia starts to decrease more slowly.

Principal Component Analysis
PCA is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data. This involves transforming the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some scalar projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.

Results
The results are visualized using scatter plots and elbow curves. The scatter plots show the clusters of cryptocurrencies, while the elbow curves show the inertia for different values of k.

Discussion
Using fewer features (via PCA) to cluster the data using K-Means results in less distinct clusters. While PCA can help simplify the data and reduce computational complexity, it may also result in loss of information that can lead to less accurate clustering. Therefore, it’s important to balance the need for simplicity and computational efficiency with the need for accurate and meaningful results when choosing the number of features to use for clustering.

Code
The code for this project involves a mix of data loading, preprocessing, model fitting, and visualization. It’s written in Python and makes use of libraries such as pandas, hvplot, and scikit-learn.
